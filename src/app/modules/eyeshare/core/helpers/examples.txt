Good morning Lucio.


I am writing this to request an increase in my grade from g9 to g10.
It is now 2 years since I last received a grade increase.
When I first joined the company I was told that the road to g11 would be approximatly 4 years.
Of course there have been difficult times the last few years and I understand this process has been slightly delayed.
I have been performing my work without failure.
My technical knowledge and expertise has grown conciderably and I believe it is more than enough
to be granted an increase in grade to atleast g10.

I have also not yet received any information about the sapphire pin that is awareded after 5 years of service
in the company. How do I proceed to find out more about this.


Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

Ekaterina
